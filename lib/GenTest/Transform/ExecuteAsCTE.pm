# NOTE: The transformer can sometimes produce syntactically incorrect
#       queries expectedly. For example, this query is accepted by MariaDB,
#       even though it's probably against the standard:
#         select 1 from dual where exists ((select 2 from dual))
#       but this one is not, because it is against the standard:
#         select 1 from dual where exists ((with cte as (select 2 from dual) select * from cte))
